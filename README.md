# FlashMe
  A quick and dirty way to send a message.



# Description
  FlashMe simplifies flash messages by consolidating them into a single module where they can be easily edited and stylized.



<!-- # Usage
  SnoopDogg is a nicer way to see Models

## Simply call 'snoop' on a Model
  - Call 'snoop' on any Model to view the Model's attributes printed out to the console
  - The Model's attributes will be sorted, color coded, and printed to the console one line at a time
  - The 'snoop' method can be called directly on the Model's class, this will print empty attributes to the console

## Feed 'snoop' arguments to view a Model's associations too
  - 'snoop' can take arguments in the form of keys matching a Model's associations
  - If the association is one-to-one, 'snoop' will find the associated record and print it below it's parent
  - If the association is one-to-many, 'snoop' will print every associated record matching that relationship
  - 'snoop' is powerful, it can print out multiple associations at once | e.g. User.first.snoop(:address, :comments) -->
